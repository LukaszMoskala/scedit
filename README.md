# scedit
Program to edit smb.conf

Name comes from `Smb.Conf EDIT`
# DISCLAIMER!
This software is NOT meant for production usage!

Code does not contain comments because I needed it done quickly
and is not optimized AT ALL!

EDIT YOUR CONFIG FILE BY HAND, BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM MAY COMPLETELY FUCK IT!

# why?
I created this program, because my teacher told us that our next exam will include sharing folders using scripts (everyone in class uses windows)
Since I have installed Linux on my school computer, I need some way to do that too. So this program is piece of shit and barely works, but it works
and I will probably use it only once.
